Create an Alexa skill using Watson Conversation and OpenWhisk
=============================================================

In this developer journey, we will create an Alexa skill using
[Watson Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation.html)
via the [Apache OpenWhisk](http://openwhisk.incubator.apache.org/) serverless framework.
Alexa is the voice service behind products like the Amazon Echo.
IBM Cloud Functions (based on Apache OpenWhisk) will be used to integrate Alexa
with Watson Conversation.
Credit goes to [Niklas Heidloff](http://heidloff.net/) for creating the original project.

An example conversation is included to demonstrate how to pass context between
different intents. You can also use this journey to try out a conversation from
the Bot Asset Exchange (BAE).

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

* Create an OpenWhisk action in the IBM Cloud Functions serverless platform
* Use Redis to store a session's conversation context across events
* Import a conversation from the Bot Asset Exchange (BAE) or a JSON file
* Invoke a conversation with Watson using Node.js
* Use the Weather Channel Data service to lookup locations and forecasts
* Create an Alexa skill to reach tens of millions of customers

## Flow
1. User says "Alexa, ask Watson...".
2. Alexa invokes IBM Cloud Functions with input text.
3. The action gets the conversation context from Redis (if any).
4. The action gets a response from Watson Conversation.
5. The Weather Company Data service provides the forecast (when applicable).
6. The response context is stored in Redis.
7. The response text is sent back to Alexa.
8. Alexa replies to the user.

-->

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
1. [Create a Watson Conversation workspace](#2-create-a-watson-conversation-workspace)
1. [Create a Compose for Redis service](#3-create-a-compose-for-redis-service)
1. [Create a Weather Company Data service](#4-create-a-weather-company-data-service)
1. [Configure credentials](#5-configure-credentials)
1. [Create the OpenWhisk action](#6-create-the-openwhisk-action)
1. [Create an Alexa skill](#7-create-an-alexa-skill)
1. [Talk to it](#8-talk-to-it)

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `alexa-skill-watson-conversation` repo locally and `cd` to the local repo
(for commands in later steps). In a terminal, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nheidloff/alexa-skill-watson-conversation
$ cd alexa-skill-watson-conversation
```

### 2. Create a Watson Conversation workspace

Sign up for [Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/) if you don't have a Bluemix account yet.

Use one or both of these options (with or without BAE) to setup a Conversation workspace.

#### Using Bot Asset Exchange (BAE)
If you are using BAE, use `Get a bot` and `Get this bot` to automatically create
your Conversation service and import your workspace(s). The service will be named
`Bot Asset Exchange Workspaces` and can hold up to 5 selected workspaces.

#### Using the provided workspace.json file
Create the service by following this link and hitting `Create`:
* [**Watson Conversation**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation)

Import the Conversation workspace.json:
* Find the Conversation service in your Bluemix Dashboard.
* Click on the service and then click on `Launch Tool`.
* Click on the **import** icon (next to the Workspaces Create button).
* Click `Choose a file` and find the local version of [`data/conversation/workspaces/workspace.json`](data/conversation/workspaces/workspace.json).
* Select `Everything` and click `Import`.

### 3. Create a Compose for Redis service

Follow this link and hit `Create`:
* [**Compose for Redis**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-redis)

### 4. Create a Weather Company Data service

If you are using the provided workspace.json, use Weather Company Data to provide weather responses.

Follow this link and hit `Create`:
* [**Weather Company Data**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/weather-company-data)

This service includes an OpenWhisk package. Run the following command to update your OpenWhisk bindings:
```
$ bx wsk package refresh
```

### 5. Configure credentials

The credentials for Bluemix services (Conversation,
Compose for Redis and Weather Company Data), can be found in the ``Services`` menu in Bluemix,
by selecting the ``Service Credentials`` option for each service.

Find the ``WORKSPACE_ID`` by clicking on the context menu of the
workspace and select **View details**.

The default runtime parameters need to be set for the action.
These can be set on the command-line or via the Bluemix UI.
Here we've provided a params.sample file for you to copy and use
with the `-param-file .params` option.

Copy the [`params.sample`](params.sample) to `.params`.

```
$ cp params.sample .params
```
Edit the `.params` file and add the required settings.

#### `params.sample:`

```json
{
  "CONVERSATION_USERNAME": "<add_conversation_username>",
  "CONVERSATION_PASSWORD": "<add_conversation_password>",
  "WORKSPACE_ID": "<add_conversation_workspace_id>",
  "REDIS_URI": "<add_redis_uri>",
  "WEATHER_URL": "<add_weather_url>"
}
```

### 6. Create the OpenWhisk action

#### Install the CLI
Install and test the IBM Cloud Functions CLI by following the steps documented [here](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn/cli).

#### Create the OpenWhisk action
Run these commands to gather Node.js requirements, zip the source files, and upload the zipped files
to create a raw HTTP web action in OpenWhisk.

> Note: You can use the same commands to update the action if you modify the code.

```sh
$ npm install
$ zip -r action.zip * 
$ bx wsk action update alexa-watson action.zip --kind nodejs:6 --web raw --param-file .params
```

### 7. Create an Alexa skill
Sign up for an Amazon Developer Portal account [here](http://developer.amazon.com/).

Follow the instructions
[here](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/registering-and-managing-alexa-skills-in-the-developer-portal#register-a-new-skill)
to register your new skill using the `Alexa Skills Kit`.

Select `Custom Interaction Model` and choose a `Name` and `Invocation Name`.

![](doc/source/images/create_skill.png)

Save and hit `Next` and then you will enter an `Intent Schema`, `Custom Slot Types` and `Sample Utterances`. We'll use a very minimal data here and let Watson Conversation do most of the work.

Copy the data from `data/alexa` to fill out these three sections.

#### Intent Schema
![](doc/source/images/intent_schema.png)
#### Custom Slot Types
![](doc/source/images/custom_slot_types.png)
#### Sample Utterances
![](doc/source/images/sample_utterances.png)

On the configuration page you need to define an **HTTPS** service endpoint which is the URL of your OpenWhisk action ending with '.json'. To find this URL, navigate to the [OpenWhisk dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/manage/actions), select your action and navigate to 'Additional Details'. Use the `Web Action URL`.

![](doc/source/images/action_details.png)

Hit `Next`. Under 'Certificate for DEFAULT Endpoint:' select the `My development endpoint is a sub-domain of a domain that has a wildcard certificate from a certificate authority` option.

Hit `Next` and your skill is ready for testing!

### 8. Talk to it

You can run the sample via Alexa enabled devices, or the [Echo simulator](https://echosim.io/) or the service simulator in the Amazon developer portal.

You can invite others to test it with the beta test feature. In order to be
eligible for beta test, you must fill out most of the publishing information.

You probably shouldn't publish this developer journey, but you are now 
ready to create and publish your own Alexa skill.

# Sample output

Here is a sample conversation flow using the provided conversation workspace.json:

- User: Alexa, ask my skill what do you know about me
- Alexa/Watson: I don't know anything about you. Where do you live?
- User: Berlin
- Alexa/Watson: Now I know you live in Berlin
- User: Alexa, ask my skill what is the weather
- Alexa/Watson: Looking up weather information for Berlin ...

The sample has been implemented via the [slots filling](http://heidloff.net/article/conversation-watson-slots) functionality in Watson Conversation. The screenshot shows how the entity (slot) 'location' is defined as mandatory and how the value is stored in a context variable.
